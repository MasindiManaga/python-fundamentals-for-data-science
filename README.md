# Python Fundamentals for Data Science

This repository demonstrates my understanding of core Python concepts as they apply to data science and analytical problem-solving. It forms the foundation for more advanced work in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

The focus is not only on syntax, but on writing clean, logical code that can later be extended to real-world data projects.

## Lesson 1: Variables and Basic Types

This lesson demonstrates:
- Python's object-based memory model
- Differences between mutable and immutable types
- Identity inspection using id()
- Small systems built from basic constructs

Mini-projects include:
- Student identity card generator
- Age and life statistics calculator
- Python object inspector

## Lesson 2: Operators and Input

This lesson demonstrates how raw input is transformed into
meaningful decisions using operators, expressions, and logic.

Mini-projects include:
- Value comparison system
- Access eligibility checker
- Personal expense reasoner

## Why This Matters for Data Science

These concepts are essential for:
- Writing reusable data processing functions
- Cleaning and transforming datasets
- Implementing algorithms from scratch
- Understanding how libraries like Pandas and NumPy work under the hood

This repository serves as a strong foundation before moving into exploratory data analysis and machine learning projects.

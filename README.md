# Python Fundamentals for Data Science

This repository demonstrates my understanding of core Python concepts as they apply to data science and analytical problem-solving. It forms the foundation for more advanced work in data analysis, machine learning, and statistical modeling.

The focus is not only on syntax, but on writing clean, logical code that can later be extended to real-world data projects.

---
## Lesson 1: Variables and Basic Types

This lesson demonstrates:
- Python's object-based memory model
- Differences between mutable and immutable types
- Identity inspection using id()
- Small systems built from basic constructs

Mini-projects include:
- Student identity card generator
- Age and life statistics calculator
- Python object inspector

## Lesson 2: Operators and Input

This lesson demonstrates how raw input is transformed into
meaningful decisions using operators, expressions, and logic.

Mini-projects include:
- Value comparison system
- Access eligibility checker
- Personal expense reasoner

## Lesson 3: Conditionals and Decision-Making

This lesson introduces conditional logic, which allows programs to make decisions based on rules and conditions.
The focus is on understanding how programs choose one execution path over another using truth values.

Key concepts covered:
- if, elif, and else statements
- Boolean conditions
- Nested decision logic
- Input normalization (lower(), strip())

Mini-projects include:
- Role classification system
- Smart feedback generator based on performance ranges
- Introductory decision logic for system-like behavior (e.g. elevators)

## Lesson 4: Loops and Repetition Thinking

This lesson introduces loops, which allow programs to repeat actions and remain active over time.
The emphasis is on understanding when and why repetition is needed, not just how to write loops.

Key concepts covered:
- while loops and condition-controlled repetition
- Loop termination using break
- Avoiding infinite loops
- Designing user-driven systems

Mini-projects include:
- Menu-based system with continuous user interaction

## Lesson 5: Lists

This lesson introduces lists as ordered containers for storing and tracking data over time.

Key ideas include:
- Growing collections
- Tracking history
- Indexing and slicing
- Lists as system memory

Mini-projects include:
- Collection builder
- History tracker
- List inspection tools

## Lesson 6: Functions

This lesson introduces functions as reusable, trusted units of logic.

Key ideas include:
- Input/output contracts
- Returning vs printing
- Scope and isolation
- Reusability and composition

Mini-projects include:
- Age calculator
- Eligibility checker
- Expense analyzer

## Why This Matters for Data Science

These concepts are essential for:
- Writing reusable data processing functions
- Cleaning and transforming datasets
- Implementing algorithms from scratch
- Understanding how libraries like Pandas and NumPy work under the hood

This repository serves as a strong foundation before moving into exploratory data analysis and machine learning projects.
